Proposal: Analyzing Exercise Trends Across Different Cities

Project Overview
Project Name: Analyzing Exercise Trends Across Different Cities

Team: Group 3

Introduction
We want to explore how climate, city design, culture, and socioeconomic status affect exercise habits in various cities.

Objectives:
Collect Data: Use Geoapify and Open Weather APIs to get data about city demographics, geography, and weather.
Gather Exercise Data: Obtain anonymized exercise data from a popular exercise app.
Group Cities: Use clustering methods to categorize cities based on exercise patterns.
Analyze Correlations: Study the relationship between exercise habits and factors like climate, urban density, and socioeconomic status.
Create Visuals: Develop visuals such as heatmaps and scatter plots to show our findings.

Hypothesis:
We believe that exercise habits differ based on location due to factors like climate, city layout, culture, and socioeconomic conditions.

Key Questions:
Do warmer cities have more outdoor exercise?
Are exercise preferences (e.g., jogging vs. gym workouts) different in various regions?
How do city features (e.g., bike lanes, parks) impact exercise habits?

Outcome:
Our study could provide insights that help city planners, health initiatives, and the fitness industry encourage healthier lifestyles in different regions.
