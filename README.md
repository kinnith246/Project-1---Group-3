# Project-1---Group-3

Proposal: Does having a Fitbit inspire people to meet the recommended exercise guidelines

Project Overview
Project Name: 

Team: Group 3

Introduction
With the introduction of fitness apps and gadget, 


Objectives:
Data Cleaning and Preparation
1. Are there any missing or duplicate entries in the dataset? How can they be handled?
2. How can you handle outliers in the dataset, especially in TotalSteps or Calories?
3. Is there a need to normalize or standardize any columns for better analysis?

# Activity and Distance Analysis (Ken)
1. What is the correlation between TotalSteps and TotalDistance?
2. How does VeryActiveDistance compare to ModeratelyActiveDistance and LightActiveDistance on average?
3. What is the distribution of TotalDistance across different levels of activity (VeryActiveDistance, ModeratelyActiveDistance, LightActiveDistance, SedentaryActiveDistance)?
4. What percentage of total distance comes from TrackerDistance versus LoggedActivitiesDistance?


# Time-Based Analysis (Cathy)
1. How do TotalSteps vary by day of the week?
   -You may need to extract the day of the week from ActivityDate.
2. What is the trend of TotalSteps over time?
  - Plot TotalSteps over the range of ActivityDate.
3. Is there a particular time period with higher VeryActiveMinutes compared to other periods?
4. Timeseries of how their exercise varied throughout the month


# Calorie Analysis (Sima)
1. What is the relationship between TotalSteps and Calories burned?
2. Which activity (Very Active, Fairly Active, Lightly Active, Sedentary) contributes most to calorie burn?
3. What is the percentage of actvity levels based on activity minutes?


# User Comparison (possibly answers will come out from analysis of other questions and change below questions a bit to cater for our analysis) (Aisling)
1. How do different users (Id) compare in terms of TotalSteps and TotalDistance?
2. Which user has the highest average VeryActiveMinutes?
3. What is the distribution of SedentaryMinutes among users?

# Advanced Analysis (if time permits, but some q's are a bit vague) (Aisling)
Statitistical summaries and tests
1. Can you cluster users based on their activity patterns?
  - Use clustering techniques like K-means to group users by their TotalSteps, VeryActiveMinutes, etc.
2. Is there any seasonal trend in activity levels?
  -You may need to extract the month from ActivityDate and analyze activity levels by month.
3. How does activity level (e.g., TotalSteps, Calories) change before and after a specific event?
  - If you have data on a specific event date, compare activity levels before and after the event.


Visualization
1. Create visualizations to show the distribution of TotalSteps among users.
2. Plot Calories burned against VeryActiveMinutes to see the relationship.
3. Visualize the average TotalSteps by day of the week.
