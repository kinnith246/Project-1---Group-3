Project 1 - Group 3

Idea: Analyzing Exercise Trends Across Different Cities

Data Sources:
  Exercise Tracking Apps: Google FIT and Google REST API
  City Demographic and Geographic Data: Geoapify API
  Weather data: Open Weather API

Hypothesis:
  Hypothesize that exercise patterns vary based on location due to factors like climate, urban design (availability of parks, gyms), cultural norms, and socioeconomic status.

Approach:
  Data Collection: Obtain anonymized exercise data from a popular exercise app (if available), including location information.

Data Analysis:
  Location Clustering: Use clustering algorithms to group cities or regions based on exercise patterns.
  Correlation Analysis: Explore correlations between factors such as climate (temperature, precipitation), urban density, socioeconomic indicators, and exercise frequency.
  Visualization: Create visualizations such as heatmaps, scatter plots, or choropleth maps to illustrate the relationships found.

Key Questions:
  Do cities in warmer climates see higher overall levels of outdoor exercise?
  Are there regional differences in exercise preferences (e.g., urban jogging vs. gym workouts)?
  How does urban infrastructure (like bike lanes or public parks) correlate with exercise habits?

Outcome:
  Insights gained could inform urban planning decisions, health initiatives, or fitness industry strategies.
  It could also lead to recommendations on how to promote healthier lifestyles based on regional characteristics.
